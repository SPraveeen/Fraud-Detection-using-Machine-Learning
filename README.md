# Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
Project Description:
In this project, I developed a machine learning-based solution to detect fraudulent transactions using Python libraries such as Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas. The objective was to build a predictive model capable of identifying potential fraud in transactional datasets with high accuracy and minimal false positives.

The project involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the application of classification algorithms to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

Key Features & Technologies:
Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values, performed feature selection, and balanced the dataset using techniques like SMOTE or undersampling to address class imbalance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Used Pandas and NumPy for in-depth data analysis and visualization to understand fraud patterns and correlations.

Model Development:
Implemented machine learning models using Scikit-learn, including:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Performance Evaluation:
Assessed models using metrics such as:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-Score

ROC-AUC Curve

Confusion Matrix

Outcome:
Successfully developed a robust fraud detection model with high recall, minimizing false negatives, which is critical in fraud detection scenarios.

Tools & Libraries:
✅ Scikit-learn
✅ Pandas
✅ NumPy
✅ Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualizations, if applicable)

Conclusion:
The project demonstrated the effectiveness of applying machine learning techniques to real-world fraud detection problems. It highlights my ability to work with imbalanced datasets, apply proper evaluation metrics, and use Python's data science ecosystem to build and evaluate models efficiently.
